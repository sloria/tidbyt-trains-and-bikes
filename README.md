## Running it locally

Install deps (requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)):

```
uv sync
brew install pixlet parallel
```

Copy the .env file:

```
cp .env.local.example .env
```

Modify `.env` with proper values. Variables with the `CHANGEME` placeholder are required.

Run both the API server and the Tidbyt server simultaneously (requires GNU parallel, installed above):

```
make serve
```

Open http://localhost:8080/ to view the TidByt preview app.

### Pushing to your Tidbyt

To actually show the app on your Tidbyt, make sure that `TIDBYT_API_KEY` and `TIDBYT_DEVICE_ID` in `.env`.
You can find these in the Tidbyt mobile app.

```
TIDBYT_API_KEY=CHANGEME
TIDBYT_DEVICE_ID=CHANGME
```

Then run the server with `TIDBYT_ENABLE_PUSH=1`:

```
TIDBYT_ENABLE_PUSH=1 make serve
```

## FAQ

### Why not use the official apps?

Tidbyt's official NYC Subway app limits you to viewing one station at a time. Citibike and weather are separate apps.
Checking all the transit options means waiting for multiple screens. This app consolidates everything I need
into one screen.

### Why not publish this as a community app?

Short answer: This code was written specifically for my apartment. Iâ€™m not particularly interested in supporting community usage.

Slightly longer answer: Tidbyt's Starlark SDK has limitations when it comes to querying complex APIs like the MTA's GTFS feed. This requires the use of a proxy server, which means the app is no longer purely Starlark-based. I have no desire to expose the proxy server to the internet or have others depend on it for their devices.
